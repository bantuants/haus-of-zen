# Logo Instructions

To add your Haus of Zen logo:

1. Save your logo as `logo.svg` (preferred) or `logo.png`
2. Place it in the `public/` directory
3. The navbar will automatically display it alongside the text

Recommended logo specifications:
- Format: SVG (preferred for scalability) or PNG
- Size: 200x200px minimum for PNG, scalable for SVG
- Background: Transparent preferred
- Style: Should match your botanical/minimalist brand aesthetic

Current setup:
- A placeholder SVG logo is included that matches your text styling
- The navbar shows both logo and text by default
- If no logo file exists, it gracefully falls back to text-only

To use your own logo:
- Replace `/Users/aliyaahnicole/Downloads/haus-of-zen/public/logo.svg` with your logo file
- Or add your logo as `logo.png` and update the navbar component

The logo appears in both desktop and mobile navigation.
